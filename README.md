# movie app

This is the movie application made using react js
This app fetches the movies from the The Movie DB API and shows the result on your home page
For more detail of a particular movie you just to click the detail button and it will redirect you (without refreshing page) and shows you all the detail of the movie.
I used react router, react hooks and redux for this project ðŸ™‚
